# Tiny Village

## Goals

Goals are to improve land use as well as energy and resource efficiency, reduce commute times, reduce injury and deaths from vehicle accidents, and overall increase quality of life.

## Subvivision of Surburban Plots

The core idea is to subdivide each  residential surburban 
plot into 9 lots.  Given a typical lot size of 60'x60',
that means each plot is 18'x18' with 6' on the side in the center
for passage.
