<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Goals are to improve land use as well as energy and resource efficiency, reduce commute times, reduce injury and deaths from vehicle accidents, and overall increase quality of life.</p>
<h2 id="subvivision-of-surburban-plots">Subvivision of Surburban Plots</h2>
<p>The core idea is to subdivide each  residential surburban 
plot into 9 lots.  Given a typical lot size of 60&#39;x60&#39;,
that means each plot is 18&#39;x18&#39; with 6&#39; on the side in the center
for passage.</p>
